### 👋 Hi I'm Jasen!

I live near Austin Texas. I love community, chickens 🐔 and growing my own food 🌱

### What I do = 💻 + 🔨

I'm a web developer, and very passionate about the Open Source ecosystem and methodologies. My preferred languages are bash and javascript, and frontend frameworks are Vue.js/Nuxt.js (but I can React and Angular too). Most of my adult life I have worked as a carpenter and builder, but I have always loved computers and electronics. I found Linux many years ago (after getting the blue screen of death); and have not turned back since, this has proven quite useful as most of the web now runs on Linux. After 25 years as a carpenter and builder; I decided to make a career change and follow my passion in tech and developing software.

<!-- I completed the Galvanize Software Engineering immersive in 2018. -->

<!-- I currently work as a freelance developer, and a part-time teacher at Greenbriar Community School. -->

<!-- I am open to new opportunities. Here is my **<a href="/jasenmichael-resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>**. **Vue.js**, **Nuxt.js**, **Tailwindcss**, **Netlify**, and **System76** to the front of the line! 😁 -->

### Fun Facts

I can 🛹 kickflip a 4 stair, and make fire 🔥 with just things lying around the forest.

### ☕ Let's have coffee
