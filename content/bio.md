### 👋 Hi I'm Jasen!

I live near Austin Texas. I love community, chickens 🐔 and growing my own food 🌱

### What I do = 💻 + 🔨

I'm a web developer, and very passionate about the Open Source ecosystem and methodologies. My preferred tools are Vue.js/Nuxt.js (but I can React and Angular too). Most of my adult life I have worked as a carpenter and builder, but I have always loved computers and electronics, then I found Linux many years ago (after getting the blue screen of death); and have not turned back since, this has proven quite useful as most of the web now runs on Linux. After 25 years as a carpenter and builder; I decided to take a career change and follow my passion to develop software. I completed the Galvanize Software Engineering immersive in 2018.

I currently work as a freelance developer, and a part-time teacher at Greenbriar Community School.

I am open to new opportunities. **Vue.js**, **Nuxt.js**, **Tailwindcss**, **Netlify**, and **System76** job offers to the front of the line! 😁

### Fun Facts

I have three children, I can kickflip 🛹 a 4 stair, and make fire without a lighter or matches. I dream of being part of a team that has a significant positive impact.

### ☕ Let's have coffee
